# FastMCP Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrate from custom MCP implementation to FastMCP 2.0 for improved development efficiency and production-ready features.

## Current State
- Custom MCP server with 300+ lines of boilerplate
- Working implementation with comprehensive tests
- Minimal dependencies (websockets + stdlib)
- Cross-platform browser detection and history extraction

## Target State
- FastMCP 2.0 implementation with 90% less code
- Production-ready features (auth, deployment, testing)
- Official MCP ecosystem integration
- Maintained browser history functionality

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✅
- [x] Install FastMCP 2.11.0
- [x] Create new `fastmcp` branch
- [ ] Create simple FastMCP server with existing browser logic
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Compare performance and compatibility

### Phase 2: Core Migration
- [ ] Replace `historyhounder/mcp/server.py` with FastMCP implementation
- [ ] Migrate existing tools:
  - [ ] `get_browser_history`
  - [ ] `get_history_statistics` 
  - [ ] `list_supported_browsers`
- [ ] Update CLI integration
- [ ] Maintain existing browser detection logic

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Add authentication (if needed)
- [ ] Implement deployment tools
- [ ] Add AI platform integrations
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Update unit tests for FastMCP
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance comparison
- [ ] Security validation

## Files to Modify

### Core Files
- `historyhounder/mcp/server.py` → Replace with FastMCP implementation
- `historyhounder/cli.py` → Update MCP server command
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py` → Update for FastMCP patterns

### Keep Unchanged
- `historyhounder/mcp/tools.py` → Reuse browser logic
- `historyhounder/mcp/browser_detection.py` → Reuse detection logic
- `historyhounder/mcp/models.py` → May need updates for FastMCP
- `historyhounder/mcp/config.py` → May need updates for FastMCP

## Benefits Expected
- 90% code reduction (300+ lines → ~30 lines)
- Production-ready authentication and deployment
- Official MCP ecosystem integration
- Built-in testing and error handling
- Future-proof protocol compliance

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Parallel testing, gradual migration
- **Risk**: Additional dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: FastMCP is well-maintained and official
- **Risk**: Learning curve
  - **Mitigation**: FastMCP is designed to be simple and Pythonic

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] 90%+ code reduction achieved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Production-ready features available

## Rollback Plan
- Keep `mcp` branch as backup
- Can revert to custom implementation if needed
- Gradual migration allows partial rollback
