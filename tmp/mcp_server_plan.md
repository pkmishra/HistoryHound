# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Browser History â€“ Feature Plan

## 1. Overview of Current State

* HistoryHounder has a FastAPI server (`server.py`) that provides REST API endpoints for semantic search and Q&A functionality.
* Browser history extraction logic exists in `extract_chrome_history.py` and `history_extractor.py` but is not exposed as an MCP server.
* No MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation exists - this is a new feature that will allow AI models to directly access browser history data through the standardized MCP protocol.
* Current architecture focuses on semantic search and Q&A rather than raw data access for AI model context.
* The project follows a modular structure with separate modules like `llm/` for specific functionality.

## 2. Overview of Final State

A new **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** will:

* Implement the MCP specification to provide browser history data as context for AI models.
* Expose browser history through standardized MCP tools (list_tools, call_tool, etc.).
* Support multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) with cross-platform compatibility.
* Provide filtering capabilities (date ranges, domains, visit counts) via MCP tool parameters.
* Run as a standalone server that AI models can connect to for context retrieval.
* Include comprehensive unit and integration tests following MCP specification.
* Support both synchronous and asynchronous tool calls as per MCP standards.
* Follow the existing modular architecture pattern with a dedicated `mcp/` module.
