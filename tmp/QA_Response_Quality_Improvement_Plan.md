## Technical Implementation Details

### Question Classification Algorithm
```python
def classify_question_type(question: str) -> QuestionType:
    # Statistical patterns: "how many", "what's the total", "top X"
    # Temporal patterns: "yesterday", "last week", "recently"  
    # Semantic patterns: "what is", "explain", "about"
    # Comparative patterns: "compare", "difference", "vs"
    # Factual patterns: "when did", "where", "who"
```

### Prompt Template Structure
```python
class PromptTemplate:
    base_instruction: str
    question_type_specific: str
    context_formatting: str
    output_structure: str
    citation_requirements: str
```
