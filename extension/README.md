4. Click on any result to open that page

### Advanced Filtering

- **Domain Exclusion**: Enter domains to exclude (e.g., "google.com, facebook.com")

### AI Q&A
1. Perform a search first to provide context
2. Use the Q&A section to ask questions about your history
3. Get intelligent answers based on your browsing patterns

**Question Types Supported**:
- **Statistical Questions**: "What is the most visited website?" - Returns accurate visit count analysis
- **Domain-Specific Questions**: "How many times did I visit GitHub?" - Aggregates visit counts for specific domains
- **Semantic Questions**: "What AI-related websites did I visit?" - Content-based search and analysis

2. Access a persistent workspace with advanced features
3. Use the tabbed interface for different functionalities:
   - **Search Tab**: Advanced search with filters and quick actions

   - **Stats Tab**: Detailed browsing statistics and analytics
4. Enjoy persistent chat history and enhanced workspace features

### Settings
- Click the "Settings" button to customize your experience
- Your preferences are automatically saved

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All history data is processed locally in your browser
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or store your browsing data
- **Secure Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for functionality
- **Open Source**: Full transparency with open source code

## Syncing History to Backend

When you use the "Sync History to Backend" button in the extension settings, the extension will now automatically filter and map your browser history data to only the required fields and correct types before sending it to the backend. This ensures compatibility with the backend API and prevents 422 Unprocessable Entity errors.

### Troubleshooting

- **422 Unprocessable Entity Error**: If you see this error when syncing history, make sure you are using the latest version of the extension. The extension must send only the required fields (`id`, `url`, `title`, `lastVisitTime`, `visitCount`) and ensure they are the correct types. If you have modified the extension, ensure this mapping is present in `settings.js`.
